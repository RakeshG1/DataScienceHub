4.	Prophet:
o	Developed by Facebook, Prophet is designed for forecasting time series with seasonality and holidays.
o	It can handle missing data and outliers.
o	You can use Prophet to model each device’s behavior and predict hourly values.


•	Data Characteristics: Consider the presence of trends, seasonality, and non-linearity.
•	Data Availability: Simpler models like ARIMA or Prophet might be better with limited data.
•	Computational Resources: RNNs and LSTMs can be computationally expensive to train.


Prophet:
•	Strengths: 
o	Flexible: Handles trends, seasonality, holidays, and other effects effectively.
o	Outlier Detection: Can identify and downplay the influence of outliers in forecasts.
o	Easy to Use: Open-source and comes with user-friendly tools for implementation.
o	Scalable: Works well with large datasets.
•	Weaknesses: 
o	Limited Non-linearity Handling: While it can capture some non-linear trends, it might not be the best choice for highly non-linear time series.

•	Computational Resources: If you have limited resources, Prophet's efficiency might be more practical.
•	Interpretability: If understanding the "why" behind forecasts is crucial, Prophet's interpretability could be an advantage.

**Prophet** is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook, designed to address many of the complexities commonly encountered in time series data. It is particularly well-suited for datasets with irregularities, trends, and seasonality. Here's how Prophet addresses each of the mentioned characteristics:

1. **Outliers**:
   - Prophet can handle outliers by using a robust regression model that is less affected by extreme values in the data.

   --------------> based on Piecewise_Regression model

2. **Linearity**:
   - While Prophet is primarily designed to capture non-linear patterns in time series data, it can also accommodate linear relationships if they exist in the data.

   --------------> based on Piecewise_Regression model

3.   **Non-linearity**:
   - Prophet is capable of capturing non-linear relationships between variables over time. It utilizes a piecewise linear or logistic growth trend model that can adapt to the data's changing patterns.

4. **Trend**:
   - Prophet automatically detects and models both short-term and long-term trends present in the data. It uses a flexible trend component that allows for changes in trend direction and rate.

5. **Seasonality**:
   - Prophet can handle various types of seasonality, including daily, weekly, and yearly patterns. It employs Fourier series expansions to model seasonal effects, making it suitable for datasets with complex seasonal patterns.

6. **Forecasting based on observed behavior**:
   - Prophet uses historical data to learn patterns and relationships in the data and makes forecasts based on observed behavior in the past. It automatically identifies changepoints in the time series, allowing the model to adapt to changes in the data's underlying patterns.

Overall, Prophet is a versatile and powerful tool for time series forecasting that can accommodate a wide range of data characteristics, making it suitable for many real-world forecasting applications.

Prophet offers several hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve forecast quality and tailor the model to specific datasets. Here are some key hyperparameters you can adjust in Prophet:

1. **Seasonality Parameters:**
   - `seasonality_mode`: Determines the method used to model seasonality. Options include 'additive' (default), 'multiplicative', or 'auto'.
   - `seasonality_prior_scale`: Strength of the prior on the seasonality. Increasing this parameter makes the model more flexible and prone to overfitting to seasonal patterns.
   - `changepoint_prior_scale`: Strength of the prior on the changepoints. Higher values allow more flexibility in capturing abrupt changes in the time series.

2. **Holiday Parameters:**
   - `holidays_prior_scale`: Strength of the prior on holiday effects. Increasing this parameter allows the model to assign more weight to holiday-related fluctuations.
   - `holiday_seasonality`: Whether to include seasonality related to holidays. Can be set to 'auto', 'additive', or 'multiplicative'.

3. **Trend Parameters:**
   - `growth`: Growth trend specification. Options include 'linear', 'logistic' (requires specifying capacities), or 'flat'.
   - `changepoints`: List of dates at which to include potential changepoints in the trend.

4. **Model Uncertainty:**
   - `mcmc_samples`: Number of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples used to estimate uncertainty intervals. Increasing this parameter improves the accuracy of uncertainty estimates but also increases computation time.
   - `uncertainty_samples`: Number of simulated draws used to estimate uncertainty intervals. Higher values lead to more accurate uncertainty estimates but also increase computation time.

5. **Additional Regressors:**
   - `add_regressor`: Allows the inclusion of additional regressors in the model, such as external predictors or covariates.

6. **Seasonality Parameters (for Daily Data):**
   - `daily_seasonality`: Whether to include daily seasonality. Can be set to 'auto', True, or False.

To improve forecast quality, you can experiment with adjusting these hyperparameters based on the characteristics of your dataset and the specific forecasting task. It's often beneficial to perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as grid search or random search to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that maximizes forecast accuracy.

Here's an example of how to set some of these hyperparameters when initializing a Prophet model:

```python
model = Prophet(
    seasonality_mode='multiplicative',
    seasonality_prior_scale=10.0,
    changepoint_prior_scale=0.5,
    holidays_prior_scale=20.0,
    holiday_seasonality='auto',
    growth='linear',
    mcmc_samples=300,
    uncertainty_samples=1000,
    daily_seasonality='auto'
)
```

Adjust these hyperparameters based on your domain knowledge, the characteristics of your data, and the specific requirements of your forecasting task to achieve better forecast performance.
